# aidb-rag
An application to demonstrate how can you make a RAG using `EDB's aidb` and `PostgreSQL`.
The chat console below illustrates the features of a RAG system designed to answer questions specifically about EDB Bloggers. 
The biographies have been collected from EDBâ€™s website. The system can work with either a local folder containing text files or an S3 bucket, and aidb will manage the content from these sources seamlessly. Once a new file is added, aidb automates the process by integrating the new information into the pipeline, enabling the RAG to respond with up-to-date answers. If no relevant data is available, it will respond with: "I'm sorry, I couldn't find any information about this person."
