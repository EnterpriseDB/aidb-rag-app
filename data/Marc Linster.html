  Chief Technology Officer, EDB
  Marc Linster, Ph.D., is EDB’s Chief Technology Officer. Marc is committed to EDB being an accelerator to providing architectural “know how” to help customers take advantage of Postgres without significant risk and cost. Marc believes that although new customer adoption of open source is easier than the experience of purchasing proprietary options, tools are still incredibly important, and EDB’s professional services practices provides them.
  Marc has an extensive background in engineering, technology and logistics with 20 years of management experience. He holds a Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat) in Computer Sciences from the University of Kaiserslautern in Germany. Before joining EDB, Marc spent four years at Polycom, the leading maker of video communications equipment, where most recently he was a Senior Director, Engineering for Cloud and Hosted Solutions. Before Polycom, Marc was Co-founder and President of TriPoint Interactive, a global supply chain consulting and systems integration company. He spent six years at Avicon Group, first as CTO and then as Vice President of Operations. Marc is an avid equestrian.
